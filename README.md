### What I’m working on
- **AI in Global Mobility**: Using AI to elevate assignee experience and give clients contextual program insights (benchmarks, risk signals, ROI) across Tax, Immigration, Business Travel, Remote Work, Payroll, and Equity.
- **Partner Ecosystem & Integrations**: Building a marketplace-style model for rapid, productized integrations and cleaner data exchange.
- **Developer Experience**: Clear docs, reusable components, and “golden” data patterns so teams ship faster with higher quality.

> I like shipping pragmatic, outcome-driven products—measurable adoption, faster time-to-value, and durable technical foundations.
